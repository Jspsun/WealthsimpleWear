# Wealthsimple Wear (A homebrewed watchface)
A smartwatch face for personal use. Interfaces with a [Wealthsimple api](https://github.com/Jspsun/UnofficialWealthsimpleApi) that I built.
  
I like to habitually check my portfolio balance just cause it's kind of fun to see it go up (and down).
Anyways, I just put together an [api](https://github.com/Jspsun/UnofficialWealthsimpleApi) for checking parts of my portfolio and the watch just posts a JSON to grab all those juicy portfolio details :^)

### Check it out :D
